# Getting started with F#

Note: this document will be expanded later.

## Installation

For various options to install F# on your machine, see the 
[documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/install-fsharp?tabs=windows).

These tutorials will use [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for presentation purposes.

## Using F# interactive

In Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, select some code in an `*.fs` or `*.fsx` file and press ALT+Enter
to quickly run/evaluate the selected code part in the F# interactive window.

You can also write code directly to the F# interactive console that will run when you close your code with a `;;` and press Enter.

## Try from a browser

Go to [fsbolero.io](fsbolero.io) (using Mozilla Firefox gives the best performance).
This is a simple tool that runs completely in your browser to compile and run single file F# projects.
